- Use [Mantin table](mdc:https:/mantine.dev/core/table) and [Tanstack Table](mdc:https:/tanstack.com/table/latest) to create table UI 
- The component should receive [table instance](mdc:https:/tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/api/core/table#usereacttable--createsolidtable--useqwiktable--usevuetable--createsveltetable) as a prop called `table` from Tanstack Table
- The table should fill the width and its height of its parent container (`w: 100%` `h:100%`) 
- When column count exceeds visible width, the table should support horizontal scrolling using `<ScrollArea>`
- Implement virtualized rendering with infinite scroll as in [virtalized list with infinite scroll](https://github.com/TanStack/table/tree/main/examples/react/virtualized-infinite-scrolling)
- Each column should be defined with [column-defs](https://tanstack.com/table/latest/docs/guide/column-defs)
- The component should receive a prop named `onBottomReached`, which triggers when user scrolls to the bottom
- While loading more data, display 3 3 rows of `<Skeleton />` rows appended to the bottom of the table
- Every table cell should include a unique `data-testid`, such as `data-testid="cell-{rowIndex}-{columnKey}"`
- If a column has `enableSorting: true`, it should render a sort icon in the header and trigger sorting when clicked
